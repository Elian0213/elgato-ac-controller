This is a custom elgato plugin that I decided to make because of how much more convenient pressing a button is than grabbing my AC remote and going from there

It needs this to work [daikin-wrapper-websocket](https://github.com/Elian0213/daikin-wrapper-websocket)

# Configuration
Most of the configuration should be done in the websocket (backend) of it.

# Setup
Run the ``release.bat`` and then run the Egato file created ``Release/com.elgato.[name].DeckPlugin``
